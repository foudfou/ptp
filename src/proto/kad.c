/**
 * In Kademelia, peers are virtually structured as leaves of a binary tree,
 * which can also be vizualized as a ring. Peers are placed in the tree by
 * their node ID, which is a N bits number. The distance(A, B) = A XOR B, which
 * can be interpreted as finding the most common bit prefix btw. 2 nodes. Ex:
 * 0x0100 ^ 0x0110 = 0x0010, common prefix "00". It thus really represents a
 * distance in the tree.

port, Node ID) triples for nodes of distance between 2^i and 2^i+1 from itself,
sorted by time last seen (least-recently seen node at the head). We call these
lists k-buckets. Ex: In a 4 bits space, for node 0 and k=3,
bucket 0 has nodes of distance 1..2
bucket 1 has nodes of distance 2..4
bucket 2 has nodes of distance 4..8
bucket 3 has nodes of distance 8..16
